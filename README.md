Aluminum-Water Reaction Thermodynamics
======================================

Code for computing Gibbs free energy for different Al reaction product species.
The raw enthalpy values for the different species at different temperatures are
tabulated in the data folder. One file for each species. These values were taken
from experimental results published in literature.

How to run
----------

  1. Run `delta_G_using_numerical_Integration_of_H.m`
  2. Run `delta_g_computation.m`
